## 'whoami'


Hi! I am a 19 year old student at Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Information Systems with an empahsis on Information Security. I am pretty new to cybersecurity and I am mostly interested in pentesting/ red teaming but, most of my experience is in blueteaming. I hope you learn something new while your here!
